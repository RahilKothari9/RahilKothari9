I like building systems that <b>reason, talk, and act</b>.  
From DevInfra debugging tools to autonomous voice agents, I enjoy turning messy real-world workflows into clean, reliable software.

Currently exploring how far we can push voice agents, orchestration, and GenAI systems.  
If you are building something interesting or just want to talk systems, feel free to reach out.
